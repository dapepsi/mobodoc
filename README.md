# mobodoc (Mounting Box Documentation)

On the search for a software that allows me to document and visualize the mounting boxes in our new home, 
I was not able to find a suitable solution. So I decided to create my own software. This is how mobodoc was born.

## Planned features

- Document mounting boxes / sockets / switches including their connections and properties
- Visualize the mounting boxes on a floor plan

## Planned tech stack

- Backend: Spring
- Frontend: Angular
- Database: MySQL
